              <p>I am a Data Science enthusiast. I graduated from George Mason University with a Master's degree in Data Analytics Engineering. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University. I also have professional work experience as a SQL and Java developer for almost one year at Accenture, India. Moreover, I was interned at George Mason University where I worked on Tableau CRM for business, marketing, and analysis. I strongly believe in character, value, vision, and action. I am always passionate, self-driven about achieving my goals and ambitions. My intention is to tackle highly complex data issues and give unique solutions to them. Also, I would like to contribute my knowledge in researching about discovering hidden information in big data.
